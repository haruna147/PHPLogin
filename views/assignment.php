    // <h2>
    // loops are used to excute the same block of code a specified number of times in PHP.
    // However, its of four types, which are;

    // (1) while loop: the while loop excutes a block of code as long as the condition is true. example;


    $x=3;
    while(3<=90){
        
        print $x."<br/>";
        $x++
    }
    // therefore, figure 3 will continue adding up till its equals 90, it will check d conditions again and break. 
    // for info. about $x++ refer to oparators in php.


    // (2) Do...while loop: the do while loop will always excute the block of code once, it will then check the condition
        // and repeat while its true. example;

        $x=9;
        do{

            print $x. <br/>;
            $x++;
        }while($x<7);

        // from the example above, do while loop excute code at once. the 'whle' statement is false, therefore perfom once and break.
